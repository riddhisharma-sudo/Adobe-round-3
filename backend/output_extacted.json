    "text": "Adobe LiveCycle Rights Management (ALCRM) servers Adobe LiveCycleRights Management (ALCRM) servers let you define centralized policies to control access to documents. The policies are stored on the ALCRM server. You require server access to use them. ALCRM servers embed user access information in documents. Therefore, specify document recipients in ALCRM policies. Alternatively, let the ALCRM server retrieve the list of recipients from LDAP directories. Use ALCRM servers to set permissions for separate document tasks, for example opening, editing, and printing. You can also define document auditing policies on ALCRM servers. What is a digital signature? Digital signatures are a secure and efficient way to electronically sign and authenticate documents, ensuring their authenticity and integrity. By using digital signatures, you can sign documents quickly and easily, and be confident that they can’t be tampered with or forged. Why validate a digital signature? When you receive a signed document, you may want to validate its signature to verify the signer and the signed content. Depending on how you’ve configured your application, validation may occur automatically. Signature validity is determined by checking the authenticity of the signature’s digital ID certificate status and document integrity. To verify authenticity, the validator checks if the signer's certificate or its parent certificates are trusted. The validity of the signing certificate is also checked based on the user's Acrobat or Acrobat Reader settings. To verify document integrity, the validator checks if the signed content was altered after signing. If changes were made, the verification ensures that the signer allowed the changes.",

XML data signatures Acrobat and Acrobat Reader support XML data signatures that are used to sign data in XML Forms Architectures (XFA) forms. The form author provides XML signing, validating, or clearing instructions for form events, such as button click, file save, or submit. XML data signatures conform to the W3C XML-Signature standard. Like PDF digital signatures, XML digital signatures ensure integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation in documents. However, PDF signatures have multiple data verification states. Some states are called when a user alters the PDF-signed content. In contrast, XML signatures only have two data verification states, valid and invalid. The invalid state is called when a user alters the XML-signed content. Establish long-term signature validation Long-term signature validation allows you to verify the signature's validity long after the document was signed. To achieve this, all the necessary elements for signature validation must be embedded in the signed PDF. These elements can be embedded during the document signing process or added afterward. If certain information is not included in the PDF, the signature can only be validated for a limited time because certificates related to the signature eventually expire or are revoked. When a certificate expires, the issuing authority is no longer responsible for providing revocation status, rendering the signature unverifiable.

    "text": "Why use certificate signatures? Many business transactions, including financial, legal, and other regulated transactions, require high assurance when signing documents. When documents are distributed electronically, it's important that recipients can: • Verify document authenticity—confirming the identity of each person who signed the document • Verify document integrity—confirming that the document has not been altered in transit Certificate-based signatures provide both of these security services. Many businesses and governments have chosen to set up a certificate-based digital signature infrastructure within their organization. They use third-party certificate authorities to provide independent identity validation. Examples include: For instance, companies in the European Union who need to comply with advanced or qualified electronic signature requirements in eIDAS e-signature regulation or the ETSI PAdES standard (PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures). What can I do with certificate IDs? Once certificate-based digital IDs have been provided to end users, they can use Acrobat or Acrobat Reader software to sign PDF files and validate files they receive from others. Sign documents • Sign PDF files using certificate IDs • Place a signature box anywhere on the page • Add multiple signatures to a page • Add a time stamp to the document when working with a configured timestamp server • Certify a document with a visible or hidden signature so that recipients can verify authenticity with or without seeing a visible signature on the page • Automatically embed certificate data to support long-term validation Validate documents • Validate all signatures, confirming the identity of everyone who signed the document • Validate document integrity by tracking",

Unlike a handwritten signature, a certificate-based signature is difficult to forge because it contains encrypted information that is unique to the signer. It can be easily verified and informs recipients whether the document was modified after the signer initially signed it.

If a document has already been signed, the Certify options are disabled. When you certify a document, you can control the types of changes other people can make. You can certify with or without displaying a signature. Signatures made with the Certify or Digitally sign options comply with data protection standards specified by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). In addition, both signature types comply with the PDF Advanced Electronic Signature (PAdES) standard. Acrobat and Acrobat Reader provide an option to change the default signing format to a CAdES format. This option is compliant with Part 3 of the PAdES standard. The timestamp capability and native support for long-term validation of signatures (introduced in Acrobat 9.1) is in compliance with Part 4 of the PAdES standard.

Add a timestamp to certificate-based signatures You can include the date and time you signed the document as part of your certificate-based signature. Timestamps are easier to verify when they are associated with a trusted timestamp authority certificate. A timestamp helps to establish when you signed the document and reduces the chances of an invalid signature. You can obtain a timestamp from a third-party timestamp authority or the certificate authority that issued your digital ID. Timestamps appear in the signature field and in the Signature Properties dialog box.

A timestamp applied after signing a document uses the time provided by the timestamp server.

Diﬀerent types of sources have diﬀerent tools available for PDF conversion. In many applications, you can create PDFs by selecting the Adobe PDF printer in the Print dialog box. If a file is open in its authoring application (such as a spreadsheet that is open in Microsoft Excel), you can convert it to PDF without opening Adobe Acrobat. Similarly, if Acrobat is already open, you don’t have to open the authoring application to convert a file to PDF. Every PDF balances eﬃciency (small file size) and quality (such as resolution and color). If the balance between the file size and the quality is critical to your task, you must use an appropriate conversion method. For example, you can drag files to the Acrobat icon to create PDFs. In this case, Acrobat applies the most recently used conversion settings without providing access to those settings. If you want more control over the process, you’ll want to use another method.

When you edit text, any font that isn't available on the system is substituted by a default fall-back font for the particular script. For example, Minion Pro is the default fall-back font for Roman script fonts. The substitution of unavailable fonts by default fonts can introduce inconsistency in the look and feel of text in a PDF document. To avoid inconsistency, choose a specific font for any text that is added or modified in the PDF document from Font Options under Content Editing. 1. From the hamburger menu (Windows) or the Acrobat menu (macOS), choose Preferences. The Preferences dialog box is displayed. (Alternatively, you can press Ctrl+K keys on Windows® or Command+K keys on macOS.) 2. In the dialog box, select Content Editing under Categories to display Font Options. 3.

    "text": "Edit images or objects in a PDF About editing text and images Adobe Acrobat provides powerful tools and capabilities for editing PDF images and text. You might encounter formatting challenges that require manual adjustments. Acrobat's image-editing capabilities are limited, and using high-resolution images can lead to performance issues due to larger file sizes. To address this, improve images using other tools before adding them to PDF documents. If the original font isn't available, font substitutions may occur, altering the text's appearance. To maintain consistency across devices, we suggest you use the available fonts or embed them within the PDF. You can also enhance document accessibility using Acrobat's features, such as adding alternative text for images and proper content tagging. Refer to the following topics to learn how to add, resize, move, or replace images and objects in a PDF using Acrobat. Add images in a PDF 1. Open the PDF in Acrobat. Select Edit a PDF from the All tools menu and then select Image. 2. From the drop-down menu, select Choose image to select an image from your device or Select Generate image to generate an image from text.

Other inhibiting factors include compatibility issues, security restrictions, and large file sizes, which are more prevalent in PDFs created from scanned images. To streamline the process, consider the following best practices and guidelines before editing a scanned document: Check the accuracy of optical character recognition (OCR) output. When you open a scanned document, Acrobat automatically runs OCR in the background to make the document editable. Before editing, review the document to ensure that the content is accurate and complete. If necessary, rescan the document using the Scan & OCR > Recognize Text tool to improve the output. Enhance image quality. If the scanned PDF contains low-quality images, use the Enhance scanned file or Enhance camera image feature to improve the quality of images before attempting to edit the document. For more information, see Scan documents to PDF. Use the correct font and formatting. When editing the document, ensure that the font and formatting of the edited text match the original document as closely as possible. If you don't have the desired fonts on your computer, see Add fonts to your computer. Remove security restrictions. If the scanned PDF has security restrictions that prevent editing, remove these restrictions before attempting to edit the document. To know how to remove security from a PDF, see Unlock a PDF.

Check for compatibility issues. Ensure that the version of Adobe Acrobat you're using is compatible with the scanned PDF. If you encounter compatibility issues, try updating Adobe Acrobat. For more information, see System requirements. Save a backup copy. Always save a backup copy of the original scanned PDF before making any edits.

About the Autosave feature The Autosave feature guards against losing your work in case of a power failure by incrementally, and at regular intervals, saving file changes to a specified location. The original file is not modified. Instead, Acrobat creates an autosave file of changes, which includes all the changes you made to the open file since the last automatic save. The amount of new information that the autosave file contains depends on how frequently Acrobat saves the autosave file. If you set the autosave interval to 15 minutes, you could lose the last 14 minutes of your work if a problem occurs. Frequent automatic saving prevents loss of data, and is especially useful if you make extensive changes to a document, such as by adding comments. You can apply autosave changes to the original files when you restart Acrobat. When you close, save manually, or revert to the last-saved version of a file, the autosave file is deleted. Note: If you use assistive technology, such as a screen reader, you may want to disable the Autosave feature so that you don’t lose your place when the file is reloaded.

    "text": "Adobe LiveCycle Rights Management (ALCRM) servers Adobe LiveCycleRights Management (ALCRM) servers let you define centralized policies to control access to documents. The policies are stored on the ALCRM server. You require server access to use them. ALCRM servers embed user access information in documents. Therefore, specify document recipients in ALCRM policies. Alternatively, let the ALCRM server retrieve the list of recipients from LDAP directories. Use ALCRM servers to set permissions for separate document tasks, for example opening, editing, and printing. You can also define document auditing policies on ALCRM servers. What is a digital signature? Digital signatures are a secure and efficient way to electronically sign and authenticate documents, ensuring their authenticity and integrity. By using digital signatures, you can sign documents quickly and easily, and be confident that they can’t be tampered with or forged. Why validate a digital signature? When you receive a signed document, you may want to validate its signature to verify the signer and the signed content. Depending on how you’ve configured your application, validation may occur automatically. Signature validity is determined by checking the authenticity of the signature’s digital ID certificate status and document integrity. To verify authenticity, the validator checks if the signer's certificate or its parent certificates are trusted. The validity of the signing certificate is also checked based on the user's Acrobat or Acrobat Reader settings. To verify document integrity, the validator checks if the signed content was altered after signing. If changes were made, the verification ensures that the signer allowed the changes.",

    "text": "For a list and explanation of each warning, see the DigSig Admin Guide. XML data signatures Acrobat and Acrobat Reader support XML data signatures that are used to sign data in XML Forms Architectures (XFA) forms. The form author provides XML signing, validating, or clearing instructions for form events, such as button click, file save, or submit. XML data signatures conform to the W3C XML-Signature standard. Like PDF digital signatures, XML digital signatures ensure integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation in documents. However, PDF signatures have multiple data verification states. Some states are called when a user alters the PDF-signed content. In contrast, XML signatures only have two data verification states, valid and invalid. The invalid state is called when a user alters the XML-signed content. Establish long-term signature validation Long-term signature validation allows you to verify the signature's validity long after the document was signed. To achieve this, all the necessary elements for signature validation must be embedded in the signed PDF. These elements can be embedded during the document signing process or added afterward. If certain information is not included in the PDF, the signature can only be validated for a limited time because certificates related to the signature eventually expire or are revoked. When a certificate expires, the issuing authority is no longer responsible for providing revocation status, rendering the signature unverifiable. The necessary elements for signature validity include the signing certificate chain, certificate revocation status, and possibly a timestamp. If these elements are embedded during signing, the signature can be validated without requiring external",

Acrobat and Acrobat Reader can embed the necessary elements if available, and the PDF creator must enable usage rights for Acrobat Reader users by going to the hamburger menu (Windows) or the Acrobat menu (macOS) > Save as other > Acrobat Reader extended PDF. Note: Embedding timestamp information requires an appropriately configured timestamp server. In addition, the signature validation time must be set to Secure Time by navigating to Preferences > Security > Advanced Preferences > Verification tab. CDS certificates can add verification information, such as revocation and timestamp into the document without requiring any configuration from the signer.

Go to Preferences > Signatures > Creation & Appearances: More and make sure that the Include signature’s revocation status option is selected. 3. Sign the PDF. If all the elements of the certificate chain are available, the information is added to the PDF automatically. If a timestamp server has been configured, the timestamp is also added. Add verification information after signing In certain workflows, signature validation information may be unavailable during the signing but can be obtained later. For instance, a company official may sign a contract on a laptop while traveling without internet access. When internet access is later available, anyone validating the signature can add timestamping and revocation information to the PDF. Subsequent signature validations can also make use of this information. To add verification information after signing: 1. Ensure that your computer can connect to the appropriate network resources, and then right-click the signature in the PDF. 2. Select Add Verification Information. Information and methods used to include this long-term validation (LTV) information in the PDF comply with Part 4 of the ETSI 102 778 PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures (PAdES) standard.

    "text": "Add comments in a text box or callout You can use the Add text comment tool to create a box that contains text. You can position it anywhere on the page and adjust it to any size. A text box remains visible on the document page; it doesn’t close like a pop-up note. Text font and size are based on the system's default settings. Note: You can add comments to Japanese, Chinese, and Korean text with the Text Box tool, but you must have the Asian-language resource files installed. Text boxes allow for horizontal text only. You can use the Text callout tool to create a callout text box. Callout text boxes are handy when you want to single out—but not obscure—a particular area of a document. Callout text boxes have three parts: a text box, a knee line, and an end-point line. You can resize each part by dragging a handle. The knee line can be resized in one direction only; horizontal knee lines can be resized horizontally only; vertical knee lines can be resized vertically only. The text box expands vertically as you type so that all text remains visible. You can move the text box itself or together with the end-point line. The text box moves around a stationary anchor point—the arrow on the end-point line—created when you first click in the PDF. You can modify the color and appearance of the text box and add arrows or leaders to the end-point line. Add a comment in text box 1. From the Quick",

Streaming summaries for long PDFs When you use Generative summary to scan lengthy PDFs, Acrobat or Acrobat Reader processes the content in chunks and simultaneously streams summaries of the portions that it processes. It helps improve your productivity because you can instantly review the output and stay engaged. The key advantages of streaming summaries include: • Real-time streaming: As Acrobat or Acrobat Reader processes a lengthy PDF, it concurrently streams summaries for sections it has already analyzed. It helps eliminate any latency associated with summarizing voluminous content. • Segmented display: When you start generating the summary for your content, you'll immediately see summarized content for the sections that the Generative summary feature finished processing. • Parallel processing: While you engage with the summarized sections, the feature extracts headings, and generates summaries for the subsequent sections. Use generative AI features in meeting apps You can harness the power of generative AI features in Acrobat to gain insights from transcripts of online meetings in Microsoft Teams and Zoom. Use the generative AI features to summarize discussions or draft emails for meeting notes or action items.

They can sign agreements using a web browser, mobile device, or Acrobat / Acrobat Reader desktop application. Send in bulk allows you to upload a form and use that as a template to create and send many (hundreds!) of unique agreements, each dedicated to one external signer. Each agreement is insulated from the others and contains its own audit report. Each recipient is unaware of all other recipients. The sender has access to the agreements through their Home or Documents tab or through the Send in bulk template, which contains an Agreements report that tracks the overall status of the child agreements created from the template. Additionally, the sender can export the field-level data of all completed agreements in a CSV format using the Download Form Field Data action. To access the Send in bulk feature, do one of the following: • In the Acrobat desktop app, go to the Tools center, scroll down to the E-Sign section, and then select Send in bulk. • Sign in to Acrobat online, select the E-Sign menu in the top navigation bar, and then select Send in bulk.",

    "text": "Why use certificate signatures? Many business transactions, including financial, legal, and other regulated transactions, require high assurance when signing documents. When documents are distributed electronically, it's important that recipients can: • Verify document authenticity—confirming the identity of each person who signed the document • Verify document integrity—confirming that the document has not been altered in transit Certificate-based signatures provide both of these security services. Many businesses and governments have chosen to set up a certificate-based digital signature infrastructure within their organization. They use third-party certificate authorities to provide independent identity validation. Examples include: For instance, companies in the European Union who need to comply with advanced or qualified electronic signature requirements in eIDAS e-signature regulation or the ETSI PAdES standard (PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures). What can I do with certificate IDs? Once certificate-based digital IDs have been provided to end users, they can use Acrobat or Acrobat Reader software to sign PDF files and validate files they receive from others. Sign documents • Sign PDF files using certificate IDs • Place a signature box anywhere on the page • Add multiple signatures to a page • Add a time stamp to the document when working with a configured timestamp server • Certify a document with a visible or hidden signature so that recipients can verify authenticity with or without seeing a visible signature on the page • Automatically embed certificate data to support long-term validation Validate documents • Validate all signatures, confirming the identity of everyone who signed the document • Validate document integrity by tracking",

Digital IDs are usually password protected. They can be stored on your computer in PKCS #12 file format. Digital IDs can also be stored on a smart card, hardware token, or in the Windows certificate store. Roaming IDs can be stored on a server. Acrobat includes a default signature handler that can access digital IDs from various locations. Register the digital ID in Acrobat for it to be available for use.

Add a timestamp to certificate-based signatures You can include the date and time you signed the document as part of your certificate-based signature. Timestamps are easier to verify when they are associated with a trusted timestamp authority certificate. A timestamp helps to establish when you signed the document and reduces the chances of an invalid signature. You can obtain a timestamp from a third-party timestamp authority or the certificate authority that issued your digital ID. Timestamps appear in the signature field and in the Signature Properties dialog box. If a timestamp server is configured, the timestamp appears in the Date/Time tab of the Signature Properties dialog box. If no timestamp server is configured, the signatures field displays the local time of the computer at the moment of signing. Note: If you did not embed a timestamp when you signed the document, you can add one later to your signature. (See Establish long-term signature validation.) A timestamp applied after signing a document uses the time provided by the timestamp server. Configure a timestamp server To configure a timestamp server, you need the server name and the URL, which you can obtain from an administrator or a security settings file.

    "text": "Adobe LiveCycle Rights Management (ALCRM) servers Adobe LiveCycleRights Management (ALCRM) servers let you define centralized policies to control access to documents. The policies are stored on the ALCRM server. You require server access to use them. ALCRM servers embed user access information in documents. Therefore, specify document recipients in ALCRM policies. Alternatively, let the ALCRM server retrieve the list of recipients from LDAP directories. Use ALCRM servers to set permissions for separate document tasks, for example opening, editing, and printing. You can also define document auditing policies on ALCRM servers. What is a digital signature? Digital signatures are a secure and efficient way to electronically sign and authenticate documents, ensuring their authenticity and integrity. By using digital signatures, you can sign documents quickly and easily, and be confident that they can’t be tampered with or forged. Why validate a digital signature? When you receive a signed document, you may want to validate its signature to verify the signer and the signed content. Depending on how you’ve configured your application, validation may occur automatically. Signature validity is determined by checking the authenticity of the signature’s digital ID certificate status and document integrity. To verify authenticity, the validator checks if the signer's certificate or its parent certificates are trusted. The validity of the signing certificate is also checked based on the user's Acrobat or Acrobat Reader settings. To verify document integrity, the validator checks if the signed content was altered after signing. If changes were made, the verification ensures that the signer allowed the changes.",

    "text": "Why use certificate signatures? Many business transactions, including financial, legal, and other regulated transactions, require high assurance when signing documents. When documents are distributed electronically, it's important that recipients can: • Verify document authenticity—confirming the identity of each person who signed the document • Verify document integrity—confirming that the document has not been altered in transit Certificate-based signatures provide both of these security services. Many businesses and governments have chosen to set up a certificate-based digital signature infrastructure within their organization. They use third-party certificate authorities to provide independent identity validation. Examples include: For instance, companies in the European Union who need to comply with advanced or qualified electronic signature requirements in eIDAS e-signature regulation or the ETSI PAdES standard (PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures). What can I do with certificate IDs? Once certificate-based digital IDs have been provided to end users, they can use Acrobat or Acrobat Reader software to sign PDF files and validate files they receive from others. Sign documents • Sign PDF files using certificate IDs • Place a signature box anywhere on the page • Add multiple signatures to a page • Add a time stamp to the document when working with a configured timestamp server • Certify a document with a visible or hidden signature so that recipients can verify authenticity with or without seeing a visible signature on the page • Automatically embed certificate data to support long-term validation Validate documents • Validate all signatures, confirming the identity of everyone who signed the document • Validate document integrity by tracking",

You might encounter formatting challenges that require manual adjustments. Acrobat's image-editing capabilities are limited, and using high-resolution images can lead to performance issues due to larger file sizes. To address this, improve images using other tools before adding them to PDF documents. If the original font isn't available, font substitutions may occur, altering the text's appearance. To maintain consistency across devices, we suggest you use the available fonts or embed them within the PDF. You can also enhance document accessibility using Acrobat's features, such as adding alternative text for images and proper content tagging. Refer to the following topics to learn how to add, resize, move, or replace images and objects in a PDF using Acrobat. Add images in a PDF 1. Open the PDF in Acrobat. Select Edit a PDF from the All tools menu and then select Image. 2.

Other inhibiting factors include compatibility issues, security restrictions, and large file sizes, which are more prevalent in PDFs created from scanned images. To streamline the process, consider the following best practices and guidelines before editing a scanned document: Check the accuracy of optical character recognition (OCR) output. When you open a scanned document, Acrobat automatically runs OCR in the background to make the document editable. Before editing, review the document to ensure that the content is accurate and complete. If necessary, rescan the document using the Scan & OCR > Recognize Text tool to improve the output. Enhance image quality. If the scanned PDF contains low-quality images, use the Enhance scanned file or Enhance camera image feature to improve the quality of images before attempting to edit the document. For more information, see Scan documents to PDF. Use the correct font and formatting. When editing the document, ensure that the font and formatting of the edited text match the original document as closely as possible. If you don't have the desired fonts on your computer, see Add fonts to your computer. Remove security restrictions. If the scanned PDF has security restrictions that prevent editing, remove these restrictions before attempting to edit the document. To know how to remove security from a PDF, see Unlock a PDF.

Check for compatibility issues. Ensure that the version of Adobe Acrobat you're using is compatible with the scanned PDF. If you encounter compatibility issues, try updating Adobe Acrobat. For more information, see System requirements. Save a backup copy. Always save a backup copy of the original scanned PDF before making any edits.

About the Autosave feature The Autosave feature guards against losing your work in case of a power failure by incrementally, and at regular intervals, saving file changes to a specified location. The original file is not modified. Instead, Acrobat creates an autosave file of changes, which includes all the changes you made to the open file since the last automatic save. The amount of new information that the autosave file contains depends on how frequently Acrobat saves the autosave file. If you set the autosave interval to 15 minutes, you could lose the last 14 minutes of your work if a problem occurs. Frequent automatic saving prevents loss of data, and is especially useful if you make extensive changes to a document, such as by adding comments. You can apply autosave changes to the original files when you restart Acrobat. When you close, save manually, or revert to the last-saved version of a file, the autosave file is deleted. Note: If you use assistive technology, such as a screen reader, you may want to disable the Autosave feature so that you don’t lose your place when the file is reloaded.

You might encounter formatting challenges that require manual adjustments. Acrobat's image-editing capabilities are limited, and using high-resolution images can lead to performance issues due to larger file sizes. To address this, improve images using other tools before adding them to PDF documents. If the original font isn't available, font substitutions may occur, altering the text's appearance. To maintain consistency across devices, we suggest you use the available fonts or embed them within the PDF. You can also enhance document accessibility using Acrobat's features, such as adding alternative text for images and proper content tagging. Refer to the following topics to learn how to add, resize, move, or replace images and objects in a PDF using Acrobat. Add images in a PDF 1. Open the PDF in Acrobat. Select Edit a PDF from the All tools menu and then select Image. 2.

Other inhibiting factors include compatibility issues, security restrictions, and large file sizes, which are more prevalent in PDFs created from scanned images. To streamline the process, consider the following best practices and guidelines before editing a scanned document: Check the accuracy of optical character recognition (OCR) output. When you open a scanned document, Acrobat automatically runs OCR in the background to make the document editable. Before editing, review the document to ensure that the content is accurate and complete. If necessary, rescan the document using the Scan & OCR > Recognize Text tool to improve the output. Enhance image quality. If the scanned PDF contains low-quality images, use the Enhance scanned file or Enhance camera image feature to improve the quality of images before attempting to edit the document. For more information, see Scan documents to PDF. Use the correct font and formatting. When editing the document, ensure that the font and formatting of the edited text match the original document as closely as possible. If you don't have the desired fonts on your computer, see Add fonts to your computer. Remove security restrictions. If the scanned PDF has security restrictions that prevent editing, remove these restrictions before attempting to edit the document. To know how to remove security from a PDF, see Unlock a PDF.

About the Autosave feature The Autosave feature guards against losing your work in case of a power failure by incrementally, and at regular intervals, saving file changes to a specified location. The original file is not modified. Instead, Acrobat creates an autosave file of changes, which includes all the changes you made to the open file since the last automatic save. The amount of new information that the autosave file contains depends on how frequently Acrobat saves the autosave file. If you set the autosave interval to 15 minutes, you could lose the last 14 minutes of your work if a problem occurs. Frequent automatic saving prevents loss of data, and is especially useful if you make extensive changes to a document, such as by adding comments. You can apply autosave changes to the original files when you restart Acrobat. When you close, save manually, or revert to the last-saved version of a file, the autosave file is deleted. Note: If you use assistive technology, such as a screen reader, you may want to disable the Autosave feature so that you don’t lose your place when the file is reloaded.

Color management RGB/CMYK/Grayscale/Other Specifies the type of color management for the output file. Conversion Colorspace/Resolution Specifies a color space and resolution for the output file. You can let Acrobat determine these settings automatically. To convert color images in the file to shades of gray, choose Grayscale.

It helps eliminate any latency associated with summarizing voluminous content. • Segmented display: When you start generating the summary for your content, you'll immediately see summarized content for the sections that the Generative summary feature finished processing. • Parallel processing: While you engage with the summarized sections, the feature extracts headings, and generates summaries for the subsequent sections.

    "text": "Why use certificate signatures? Many business transactions, including financial, legal, and other regulated transactions, require high assurance when signing documents. When documents are distributed electronically, it's important that recipients can: • Verify document authenticity—confirming the identity of each person who signed the document • Verify document integrity—confirming that the document has not been altered in transit Certificate-based signatures provide both of these security services. Many businesses and governments have chosen to set up a certificate-based digital signature infrastructure within their organization. They use third-party certificate authorities to provide independent identity validation. Examples include: For instance, companies in the European Union who need to comply with advanced or qualified electronic signature requirements in eIDAS e-signature regulation or the ETSI PAdES standard (PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures). What can I do with certificate IDs? Once certificate-based digital IDs have been provided to end users, they can use Acrobat or Acrobat Reader software to sign PDF files and validate files they receive from others. Sign documents • Sign PDF files using certificate IDs • Place a signature box anywhere on the page • Add multiple signatures to a page • Add a time stamp to the document when working with a configured timestamp server • Certify a document with a visible or hidden signature so that recipients can verify authenticity with or without seeing a visible signature on the page • Automatically embed certificate data to support long-term validation Validate documents • Validate all signatures, confirming the identity of everyone who signed the document • Validate document integrity by tracking",

The policies are stored on the ALCRM server. You require server access to use them. ALCRM servers embed user access information in documents. Therefore, specify document recipients in ALCRM policies. Alternatively, let the ALCRM server retrieve the list of recipients from LDAP directories. Use ALCRM servers to set permissions for separate document tasks, for example opening, editing, and printing. You can also define document auditing policies on ALCRM servers. What is a digital signature? Digital signatures are a secure and efficient way to electronically sign and authenticate documents, ensuring their authenticity and integrity. By using digital signatures, you can sign documents quickly and easily, and be confident that they can’t be tampered with or forged. Why validate a digital signature? When you receive a signed document, you may want to validate its signature to verify the signer and the signed content. Depending on how you’ve configured your application, validation may occur automatically. Signature validity is determined by checking the authenticity of the signature’s digital ID certificate status and document integrity. To verify authenticity, the validator checks if the signer's certificate or its parent certificates are trusted. The validity of the signing certificate is also checked based on the user's Acrobat or Acrobat Reader settings. To verify document integrity, the validator checks if the signed content was altered after signing. If changes were made, the verification ensures that the signer allowed the changes.",

Subsequent signature validations can also make use of this information. To add verification information after signing: 1. Ensure that your computer can connect to the appropriate network resources, and then right-click the signature in the PDF. 2. Select Add Verification Information. Information and methods used to include this long-term validation (LTV) information in the PDF comply with Part 4 of the ETSI 102 778 PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures (PAdES) standard. The command is unavailable if the signature is invalid, or is signed with a self-signed certificate. The command is also unavailable in case the verification time equals the current time.",
